* **ASSISTANTS:**
Mika Oja

### Minutes 
12 minutes

*Summary of what was discussed during the meeting*

Our API uses are fine and overall everything was described as passed during the first meeting. UI design is not needed to implement now, because it is designed in fourth or fifth deliverables. Lot of the discussed things are described above, in the summary-option. In the future, it may be needed to expand our course project a little.

### Action points

*List here the actions points discussed with assistants*
We discussed about:
- we should open more why our project is an API, and not an invidual web software
- we could add some time management logic, and open more different purposes our API could do, instead of web SW.
- concrete concepts
- should add more concepts to our graph
- describe what our featuress can do based on objects
- 3-4 concepts are enough in this course

### Minutes
*Summary of what was discussed during the meeting*
The feedback we received:
- Delete pycache and instance folders
- add missing .gitignore DONE
- modify the table by adding also there the length of passwords etc THIS IS IMPLEMENTED IN OUR CODE, NOT IN THE PLAN
- could users and groups have unique names also? maybe generated unique names? for tasks also! GENERATED FOR USER; TASK ; GROUP (UNIQUE USER AT LEAST WORKS)
- can users belong to multiple groups? yes -> it's not convenient to delete the user also when a group is deleted. Tasks under group that is deleted can be also deleted.
- change usergroup to many to many
- add missing "role" variable to usergroup DONE
- check klikkikomennot populointiin liittyen
- use pip freeze for requirements.txt to get everything you need there
