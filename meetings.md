* **ASSISTANTS:**
Mika Oja

### Minutes 
12 minutes

*Summary of what was discussed during the meeting*

Our API uses are fine and overall everything was described as passed during the first meeting. UI design is not needed to implement now, because it is designed in fourth or fifth deliverables. Lot of the discussed things are described above, in the summary-option. In the future, it may be needed to expand our course project a little.

### Action points

*List here the actions points discussed with assistants*
We discussed about:
- we should open more why our project is an API, and not an invidual web software
- we could add some time management logic, and open more different purposes our API could do, instead of web SW.
- concrete concepts
- should add more concepts to our graph
- describe what our featuress can do based on objects
- 3-4 concepts are enough in this course
